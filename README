STUDY DESCRIPTION: A within-subjects-design involving a two-week baseline period before the running intervention, and two subsequent intervention cycles was applied. At four time points of assessment (t1: start of the study; t2: end of baseline period/start of the intervention; t3: end of the first intervention cycle; t4: end of the 2nd intervention cycle/study end) magnetic resonance imaging was performed and symptoms related to depression were assessed employing the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale. The intervention resulted in a significant increase in the estimated maximum oxygen uptake (VO2-Max), measured with a standardized walking test.

DATASET DESCRIPTION: This dataset includes demographic data, data of the CES-D Questionnaire, vo2max and T1 weighted MRI data.
